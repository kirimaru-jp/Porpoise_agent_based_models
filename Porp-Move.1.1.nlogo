; The model was developed and tested using NetLogo version 4.1. Development ended 2011-12-05

 
; debug levels: 
;   0   no debugging
;   1   debug porp_avoid_land / water depth problems
;   2   write turning angles before and after avoiding land
;   3   debugging turning angles -- esp. loop control
;   4   debugging attraction vector caused by reference memory
;   5   debugging deterrence vector caused by working memory
;   6   debugging attraction + deterrence vectors
;   7   debugging porp_get_exp_food_val -- expected value of future food

; behavioural modes in model: 
;   0   Behaviour produced by simple non-autocorrelated Markov process (except when porps seek to avoid land); 
;       variables calibrated using dead-reckoning data.
;   1   Like model 1, but introducing autocorrelation in turning angles and speed, and sharper turning angles 
;       at low speed (i.e. a correlated random walk (CRW) model). 
;   2   Extends model 1 behaviour by introducing a desire to return to return to areas with food (i.e. a reference
;       memory, cf Van Moorter, Oikos 2009). Food is eaten in the entire cell once the porp has been there. 
;       Food doesn't affect step length (intrinsic behaviour).


;   7   Extends behaviour model 1. Optimal foraging model where animal behaviour is influenced by the probability 
;       of encountering food in each of the patches it passes. The probability of finding food is assumed to decrease
;       linearly with water depth (to make porps stay on shallow water as observed in the satellite track data).
;       Food quality (energy obtained from the food found) is assumed to be constant. Porpoises are able to learn
;       where they are most likely to find food (i.e. at which depth), but do not remember where they have been.
;   8   Builds on model 3. Enables variations in food quality. 
;       This will allow porpoises to develop different feeding strategies depending on their experience: They may
;       go for low-quality food which is encountered with a high probability at shallow water, or they may go for 
;       high-quality food (schoals of cod or herring) on deeper waters.
;   9   Like behaviour model 4, but allowing porpoises to remember where they have been (this is probably necessary
;       in order to get them to stay in the same region for a long time, and maybe it is sufficient to make them
;       shift region from time to time).
