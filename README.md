# Agent based models for harbour porpoises
Julia implementation of harbour porpoise agent based models, based on https://github.com/jacobnabe/Porp-Move.
The models run > 10 times faster than the same models run on Netlogo.
- model 0 took around 3.5 seconds for 150,000 loops (with 4 porpoise agents),
- model 1 took around 10 seconds for 15,000 loops (with 4 porpoise agents).
